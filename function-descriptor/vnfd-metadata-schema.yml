  The schema for SONATA network function descriptor metatada.
  The metadata is stored inside the SONATA service platform
  along with the VNFD when the VNFD is stored in a service
  platform catalog. In contrast to the VNFD, the VNFD-metadata
  might contain values generated by the service platform.
